<p>Demon Slayer is animated beautifully and the jounery that tanjiro and nezuko <br>
   embark on so deep and meaningful, it never fails to have me on the edge of my seat.

<p>Great thrilling story that keeps blowing my mind with its plot twist.<br> 
   Its crazy action scenes are some of the best animated scenes in anime in my opinion.
